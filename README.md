In the frontend, I have used HTML , CSS and EJS templating.

In the backend, I have written NodeJs and JavaScript Codes. 

First I tested the application on local server using nodemon app.js.

For the database, I have used Mongoose and MongoDB.

Finally, I have made the application live by deploying it on Heroku.
